## How to use the OSPO Guide

There has been an OSPO terminology misalignment caused by The Open Source Program Office expansion over the past years across sectors and regions. 
The OSPO guide is an ongoing set of documents that provides a holistic view and alignment of Open Source Program Office terminology, tasks, 
and responsibilities, as well as public use cases and learning resources in a cohesive application.

### Contributing to this guide

The OSPO Guide works using a markdown file called `guide.md`. If you would like to contribute, please open at PR in the [OSPO Landscape Repo](https://github.com/todogroup/ospolandscape).

## How to use the OSPO Landscape

The OSPO landscape is intended as a map to explore the OSPO Ecosystem in terms of tooling, adopters and involved communities. It also shows current TODO members.
It is modelled after the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape and based on the same open source code.

### OSPO Adopters

Organizations who has a public OSPO or similar initiative that meets OSPO Definition requirements
  
### OSPO Tools

## OSPO Glossary

### OSPO Definition 

An open source program office (OSPO) is a designated place that acts center of competency for an organization's open source operations and structure. This can include setting code use, distribution, 
selection, auditing and other policies, as well as training developers, ensuring legal compliance and promoting and building community engagement that benefits the organization strategically.
We can categorize the functions of a typical OSPO into three categories: Legal Risk Mitigation, Improving Engineers’ Practices, and Enabling Financial Benefits. (A mnemonic: Fear, Love, and Money).

If an organization invests in a place or team to manage open source operations and structure, then it can be considered an OSPO. However, OSPOs might use different naming depending on the organization
and how advanced the program is. Some OSPO variants include:

* The Open Source Steering Committee
* Community Development team
* Open Source Software Operations
* Open Source Board
* Open Source Office

> ##### INFOBOX
> For better alignment, it is recommended to use the word OSPO or Open Source Program Office and avoid OSPO Variants as much as possible.

#### Source Code Review

Source code review is the examination of an application source code to find errors overlooked in the initial development phase. 
A tester launches a code analyzer that scans line-by-line the code of an application. The code review process also referred to as peer review, stands out 
as a tried and tested method in a large palette of applications to allow for the systematic examination of software source code. It's conducted to find bugs and improve the overall quality of the software

#### Continuous Integration (CI) / Continuous Deployment (CD) 

CI/CD is a method to frequently deliver apps by introducing automation into the stages of app development. The main concepts attributed to CI/CD are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. 
CI/CD is a solution to the problems integrating new code can cause for development and operations teams. CI/CD tools can help to automate development, deployment, and testing.

#### CLA (Contributor License Agreements) 

The agreement between the contributor and the project which gives the project additional rights on top of the rights given 
by the license. If people contribute on behalf of a company, where the company holds the rights on the work of the contributor, the company has to sign the CLA. 

There is a variety of different CLAs in use, some mostly confirm the rights already given by the license, some give additional rights such as being able to 
release the code under a different license, for example when the code is also released under a proprietary license as part of a commercial offering. With CLA, rights are collected at a central place, so changing the license, or rereleasing the code as part of a product with a different license is possible. The asymmetry of the agreement, which gives the project more rights than its contributors can impose a bigger barrier for contributions. Requiring a corporate CLA can also be an insurmountable barrier, especially for large corporations, because the effort and legal implications of checking and signing a CLA might outweigh the benefits of contributing.

#### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO): 

The DCO was introduced in Linux kernel development and has been adopted by quite some other projects. It's a statement developers give with each commit 
by including a "Signed-Off-By" statement in the commit message. With this statement developers explicitly declare that they have the rights they need to do 
the contribution and that they agree that the project is using it. This is still a low barrier, but it gives projects more security about if code was rightfully 
contributed. It does not help in cases where the license of the code needs to be changed.

## OSPO Categories & Responsibilities

OSPO functions can be structured into three categories: Legal Risk Mitigation, Improving Engineers’ Practices and Enabling Financial Benefits.

### Legal Risk Mitigation

Often, the first concern companies have is related to legal compliance. OSPOs often oversee aspects of a company’s open source license compliance process. Companies that distribute software are typically most concerned with this and initiate their OPSO around the abatement of legal risk. The responsibilities of a program office in this area includes:

* Maintaining open source license compliance reviews and oversight
* Running a review process for inbound code use
* Ensuring that the company contributes back to open source projects effectively



### Improving Engineers’ Practices 

OSPOs also improve engineering capabilities by providing guidance and policies about code management in an open source (and blended source) environment. 
Companies with many software engineers focus their OSPO on engineering policies and practices. The responsibilities of a program office in this area include:

* Clearly communicating the open source strategy within and outside the company
* Fostering an open source culture within an organization
* Ensuring high-quality and frequent releases of code to open source communities

### Enabling Financial Benefits 

Some companies focus on the financial implications of open source and leverage their OSPO to help drive a strategy around the use of commercial vs. open source vendors. Whereas some tech companies use their OPSO (and open source projects) to drive customers to commercial products. The responsibilities of a program office in this area includes:
Owning and overseeing the execution of the strategy.

* Facilitating the effective use of open source in commercial products and services
* Engaging with developer communities to encourage adoption of strategic open source projects

> Each open source program office is custom-configured based on its particular business, products, and goals.

## OSPOs In Practice

#### Autodesk
The history of Autodesk’s open source transformation began shortly after the shift of all its products to cloud began, including its AutoCAD architecture software, 
building information modeling with its Revit products, as well as its media and entertainment products. [Learn more about Autodesk’s OSPO case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/autodesk/).
#### Comcast
Comcast ’s involvement in open source was a gradual process that evolved over time. The company eventually created two open source program offices, 
one for the NBC business and another for the cable side of the business, which is the subject of this profile. Learn more about [Comcast OSPO case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/comcast/).
#### Dropbox
The open source program at Dropbox was initially just a mailing list, where some interested engineers wanted to open source projects and develop with open source. 
Over time, things became more formalized, with a focus on ensuring that the company was consistent about what code it would release versus what code was best 
kept internal. Learn more about [Dropbox case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/dropbox/).
#### Meta
Meta has a dedicated Tools team within the open source program office that is responsible for building internal tools to help manage its open source portfolio. 
This includes the projects that Meta shares, which are mostly hosted on GitHub, as well as the other external projects they contribute to such as the Linux Kernel. 
Learn more about [Meta’s case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/facebook/).
#### Microsoft
Microsoft does not have a central open source strategy or a central approval body. Instead, the Open Source Programs Office facilitates those discussions and 
decisions throughout the company. Teams still need to have their open source engagement reviewed, but it is done more locally. Learn more about [Microsoft’s 
case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/microsoft/).
#### National Instruments
From shipping its first real-time Linux device that initiated a steady stream of open source involvement across multiple company products and organizations 
to establish an open source “guild” to increase open source awarenes. Learn more about [National Instrument’s case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/ni/).
#### Red Hat
The open source and standards office at Red Hat (or what some would refer to as an open source program office) was established years ago to create a consistent way 
to support communities and open source technologies from companies we acquired from time to time. Red Hat created a centralized organization of expertise to 
support the rest of the company in achieving its goals through open source. Learn more about [Red Hat case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/redhat/).
#### Salesforce
Salesforce has many priorities around open source. The company’s open source strategy keeps everyone aligned. The dedicated open source program team circulates internal documents to the company’s engineering team that provide strategic guidance and encourage the creation and use of open source. The documents provide the foundation for an open source culture and let the team know in no uncertain terms that the company’s leaders are fully behind the strategy. Learn more about Salesforce case study.

#### SAP
SAP has been working with open source for decades and has now established an open source program office (OSPO) to further formalize the coordination of its open source activities 
and expand its engagement with the open source communities. Learn more about [SAP case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/sap/).

#### Uber
Uber is one of the best-known disruptors in the digital age. Its business model famously separated transportation services from the traditional underlying 
infrastructure with an app-based model offering on-demand and multimodal options. In many ways, this transformation, and Uber itself, also mirror the creative and 
collaborative aspects of the open source community. Learn more about [Uber case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/uber/).

### Traditional & regulated environments

#### Alliander (Energy)
Learn more about [Alliander’s OSPO case study](https://youtu.be/WjJUXfqaFCw)
#### Capital One (Banking)
The Open Source Office at Capital One adopted a comprehensive risk management approach wherein we have identified clear risk ownership around when to use, 
contribute to, and launch open source projects. Learn more about [Capital one case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/capitalone/).
#### RIT (Academics)
Open@RIT is dedicated to fostering an “Open Across The University” collaborative engine for Faculty, Staff, and Students. Its goals are to discover and grow 
the footprint, of RIT’s impact on all things Open including, but not limited to, Open Source Software, Open Data, Open Science, Open Hardware, Open
Educational Resources, and Creative Commons licensed efforts; what we like to refer to in aggregate as Open Work. Learn more about [RIT case study](https://todogroup.org/guides/casestudies/rit/).
